# Cybersecurity, Critical Data, and Social Justice
This spring, Hamilton was incapacitated by a ransomware attack we are still recovering from months later. In addition to ransomware, universities also be a target for intellectual property and research theft (Forbes). While keeping our networks secure is important, there are also critical equity considerations in how populations are disproportionately targeted and impacted by data breaches. 

In this 1-hour webinar, learn more about cybersecurity and data justice. We'll start with best practices for keeping data safe, the context of equity in relation to data breaches, critical data visualization, and approaches to involving research participants in how their data is managed. Then, we'll unpack ripped-from-the-headlines case studies to explore social justice implications.
