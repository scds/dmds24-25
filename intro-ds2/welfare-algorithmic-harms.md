# Understanding the nature and risks of welfare algorithmic harms 
With the rise of the use of networked technologies and algorithms comes the intensification of surveillance. As welfare and social assistance systems adopting AI, algorithms, and automation, the poor are increasingly subjected to new modes and intensified ways and systems of surveillance and regulation. This presentation will share what the AI, Algorithmic, and Automation Incidents and Controversies Repository (the  AIAAIC Repository) have identified as algorithmic incidents in the welfare system around the world, their nature, risks, and impacts. This presentation for the 2024 Sherman Centre Graduate Residency is a smaller part of my doctoral thesis that aims to understand how Asian solo mothers experience welfare surveillance and how do they identify and make use of their agency in this surveillance-heavy contexts.
