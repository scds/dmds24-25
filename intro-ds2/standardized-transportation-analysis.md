# Developing standardized methods for transportation analysis
Transportation poverty occurs when financial difficulties and transportation challenges make it difficult for people to participate in daily activities. In Canada, this problem is aggravated by a lack of standards to ensure the fair distribution of transportation infrastructure and limited guidance for planners to address equity in their projects. However, with data now more accessible than ever, there are opportunities to improve equity in transportation planning. My presentation highlights the standardized methods I developed for transportation analysis during my residency at the Sherman Centre. I will present the COMMUTECA21 R package, created in collaboration with McMaster University's Centre for Research Data, which provides tools for conducting transportation analysis of accessibility in any region of Canada using national survey data.
