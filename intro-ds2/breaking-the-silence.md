# Breaking the silence: Understanding HPV vaccination gaps among canadian men
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is often associated with women due to its link to cervical cancer, overshadowing the significant risk it poses to men. In Canada, men are frequently overlooked by HPV vaccination programs, leaving them vulnerable to HPV-related cancers like oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancers, due to limited awareness, cultural stigmas, and absence of targeted vaccination efforts. 

This project aims to address these gaps through a comprehensive online survey targeting men residing in Canada aged 16 and above, available in English and French. The survey explores knowledge, attitudes, and practices surrounding HPV and its vaccine. This presentation will highlight preliminary results from the first 100 participants, focusing on key trends in awareness, barriers to vaccination, and implications for public health strategies to create inclusive vaccination programs.
