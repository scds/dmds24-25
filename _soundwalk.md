# Soundwalking and Countermapping: Explore our campus through field recording and careful listening
How do we make sense of a place? Power dynamics and knowledge systems shape the ways we move within and listen to a space. This joint workshop between the Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship and Lloyd Reeds Map Collection will bring together students, faculty, staff, and community members to explore McMaster's campus through field recording and careful listening. Together, we'll spend a winter afternoon together connecting soundwalks--listening exercises along a planned route-with countermapping--creating maps that challenge dominant power structures. Beginning with an overview on sound theory, we'll move into a hands-on guided listening and recording activity using pre-printed risograph maps of McMaster's campus. If you're interested in critical mapping, sound art, or acoustic ecology, this workshop is for you!

Through your participation in this workshop, you will: 
1. Discover the context of sound studies in Canada.
2. Record clean audio of sounds of the university spaces.
3. Implement soundwalking, field recording, and countermapping as a research methodology.
4. Contribute to a group discussion around personal experiences of listening.
