# Streamline Your Research Materials Photos

You've been there--getting home from an incredible research trip to an archive, maps collection, or gallery only to face a folder with thousands of photos all labelled `IMG50293.png`. Join Research Data Management Specialist Danica Evering and Data Analysis and Visualization Librarian Subhanya Sivajothy for an overview of Tropy: an open-source solution to explore and manage research photos. Instead of a folder crammed full of a jumble of nameless files, Tropy lets you work closely with your research materials. Starting with an overview of all your images, you can zoom into details and annotate points of interest as you start to uncover your research. It also lets you find patterns and contexts through systematized tagging and metadata. Developed alongside sister softwares Zotero, a reference manager, and Omeka, a digital exhibits system, at George Mason University, it integrates smoothly with its siblings. After introducing Tropy as a tool, this webinar will discuss how to create item records in Zotero, and then how to transform your research into a digital exhibition using the Tropy-Omeka integration.  

Upon completion of this workshop, you should be able to: 
1. Use Tropy to organize, annotate, analyze and manage large research image collections.
2. Select appropriate metadata and implement documentation and tagging systems.
3. Integrate Tropy with Zotero and Omeka to cite archival sources and enhance the impact of your research and digital exhibitions.
