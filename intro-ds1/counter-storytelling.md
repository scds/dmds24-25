# The exotic Amazon and the exotic woman”: Practicing refusal through digital counter-storytelling
My project aims to be a creative digital intervention presenting illustrated AR vignettes and questions reflecting the gendered relations shaped by the long history of resource extraction in Iquitos (Peru). This project departs from the framework of refusal, a concept and practice rooted in Indigenous and Black thought. Refusal exposes and rejects the histories, knowledge production practices and relations of oppression taking away our subjecthood. However, refusal is also a creative outlet embracing the "possibility of living otherwise” (Campt, 2019). This presentation showcases three AR vignettes enacting a creative refusal by being a tool and entry point to explore the gendered violence and colonial resource extraction in Iquitos. I will discuss the possibilities digital counter-storytelling open as a process and site of political action exposing and unmasking non-innocent histories legitimizing resource extraction’s gendered violence of Amazonian girls and women.
