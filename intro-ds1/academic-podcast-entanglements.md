# Let’s talk! Academic podcast entanglements
My graduate residency project for the Sherman Centre is a podcast series titled, The Academic Podcast Entanglements. It is composed of 8 episodes of in-depth conversations with transdisciplinary academic podcasters from Humanities and Social Sciences. My presentation will focus on the ways faculty, staff, and students use podcasting as a method within knowledge mobilization systems. I will discuss the many ways podcasts engage individual or collective knowledge brokers such as academics, researchers, students, community members, organizations, etc. Through these critical conversations the academic podcast amplifies the values and tensions of: (1) lived experiences (2) co-creation of meanings (3) and building relationships. The goal is to share what we know, what we don’t know and make spaces for new ways of doing podcasting in our digital futures.
