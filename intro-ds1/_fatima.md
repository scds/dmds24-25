# Fostering Creative Confidence: Reframing Ambiguity Through Storytelling and Design Fiction
As part of my ongoing work, I have developed a workshop that empowers students from various disciplines to build ‘creative confidence’ through storytelling and by reframing ambiguity in ways that foster excitement and joy in learning. This workshop, within the context of Design Thinking education, helps students view ambiguity as an opportunity for innovation rather than discomfort. I will discuss how design fiction—a method that creates story worlds in which prototypes explore discursive spaces—facilitates this shift. Participants redesign everyday objects to reflect future scenarios or alternate realities, imagining futures that encompass technological, social, and cultural narratives. With prompts, collaborative prototyping, and reflective discussion, the workshop fosters creativity, risk-taking, and comfort with ambiguity across various fields.
