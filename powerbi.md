# Visualizing with Power BI

This workshop covers the basic of using Power BI to create visualizations. We will look at data cleaning, creating impactful charts, and building interactive dashboards. Discover how to tell your data story effectively and make informed decisions. No previous experience needed. 

## Workshop Preparation 
Access to Power BI is required. McMaster members can access the desktop version [here](https://office365.mcmaster.ca/office-365-3/applications/power-bi/getting-started-with-power-bi/). Those without access to Power BI through their organization may be able to access a [free trial](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/getting-started-with-power-bi) via Microsoft, so that they can participate in the workshop. Please note that the desktop version only works with Windows OS; participants can instead use Power BI online but it has much more limited features.

The data that we will be using during the workshop can be downloaded [here](../data/humdata_GHGEmissionsGES.xlsx).
