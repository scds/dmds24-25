# Introduction to Typesetting with LaTeX

This workshop will introduce you to [LaTeX](www.latex-project.org/), a typesetting system commonly used in STEM disciplines to create high-quality documents and easily write mathematical equations.

In this tutorial, we will discuss tools for writing in LaTeX, the structural elements of LaTeX, text formatting, and commands for writing mathematical equations. You will also learn the commands to create your first LaTeX document.
